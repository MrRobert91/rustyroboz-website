Collection of NFTs in Opensea, images made with AI and prices with a quantum random number generator.

The project was a way to explore the intersection of art, technology, and finance. The images were generated using a variety of AI models, and the prices were set using a quantum random number generator to create a truly unique and unpredictable collection.
