A short metroidvania with AI art in which you control a robot in a future where humans live on Mars. What happened? How has this situation come to be? Who is Moloch?

The game was developed in Unity, and all the art was generated using Stable Diffusion. The project was a way to explore the possibilities of using AI in game development and to create a unique and visually interesting experience.
