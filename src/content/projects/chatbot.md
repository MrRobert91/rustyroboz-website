I developed a technical interview chatbot using LangChain, the Groq API, and Streamlit Cloud. The project had two main objectives: to deeply understand how Large Language Models (LLMs) work, and to create a tool to help me prepare for technical interviews.

The chatbot is trained on my professional experience, projects, and the technologies I have worked with. It can answer questions about my career, technical skills, and problem-solving approaches. It is also capable of generating summaries of my experience and simulating technical interview scenarios.

The chatbot is deployed on Streamlit Cloud and is publicly accessible.
