Images generated from text sentences with the VQGAN and CLIP models (Generative artificial intelligence models based on transformers).

The project was a way to explore the creative possibilities of AI and to create a series of unique and visually interesting images. The images were generated by providing the models with a series of text prompts, and the results were then curated and edited to create the final collection.
