Use artwork from a space artist and finetune a stable diffusion model to learn to create images of space in her unique style.

The project was part of the NASA Hackathon, and the goal was to explore the use of AI in art. The project involved using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate new images of space in the style of a specific artist. The model was trained on a dataset of the artist's work, and the results were then used to create a series of new images.
