A VR digital twin prototype of a room, using various 3D scanning techniques and assets from a #HumbleBundle. It is built with Unity and works on the Oculus Quest 2 headset.

The project was a way to explore the possibilities of creating digital twins of real-world spaces using low-cost techniques. The goal was to create a realistic and immersive experience that could be used for a variety of purposes, such as virtual tours or training simulations.
