After selecting 42 Rusty Robozs generated with VQGAN + Clip, the next step was to create a collection of NFTs.

It seemed interesting to me to experiment a little with the creation of NFTs, I think that Blockchain technology has many possibilities and a promising future, but the speculative nature that NFTs have at the moment is undeniable, with a large number of collections that come out with 10000 nfts they all look the same. My idea was to do an experiment and test the technology, not to become a crypo millionaire by selling thousands of NFTs, so I decided to make a selection of 42 Rusty Robozs, so that there would be variety but also that they would be well differentiated between them and well, also because it is The Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything!

Some of the Rusty Robozs

Putting Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain together seemed pretty cool, but something was missing. Lately I have been interested in quantum computing, so we have to add something quantum and we also add that buzzword to the mix, if it were a startup it would surely raise several million, although what can be done currently with a quantum computer is quite limited, especially to those of IBM that we mere mortals who have very few qubits have access to, it occurred to me to make a quantum random number generator to decide the price of each NFT. The idea was that for each NFT a number between 0.01 ETH and 0.42 ETH will be generated.

Quantum number generator execution

Here is a video of the streaming in which I run the algorithm and you can see what price each NFT gets, it is not very interesting to see, and it takes a long time to execute, but it serves to record the values ​​that came out in the execution. In reality, the fact that it is quantum does not contribute much, random numbers could be generated with a normal computer, although the randomness of a quantum computer occurs at a fundamental level of matter. And if you are a fan of the multiple worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, every time we generate a price, 32 possible realities are created, since the computers we use have 5 qubits that we measure separately by collapsing their wave function. Which gives us 2^5=32 different possibilities, for each NFT.

It only remained to upload them to an NFT marketplace, I have chosen OpenSea because it is the best known and because it allows lazy minting, that is, network commissions are not paid until someone buys the NFT. This allows me not to go bankrupt if none are finally sold, as is very likely to happen if we take into account the statistics. First of all you have to use a cryptowallet like metamask to add funds to pay a fee that will allow us to upload NFTs, in addition to that being the address to which they will send us the payment if we sell any.

Once that fee is paid, we can create a collection in OpenSea to which we can upload the gifs that we have generated from each Rusty Roboz, we can associate different characteristics to each one, we are only going to assign them a name, a description and a price, although other characteristics can be added that will influence its rarity. Every time we want to put one up for sale we will have to sign an smart contract using Metamask, this contract is generated automatically by OpenSea, and we can modify some variable, such as the percentage that we want to keep each time the NFT is exchanged between other people as a royalty. Once the 42 Rusty Robozs are on sale, we already have our NFT collection finished!

Finally, it seemed to me that I should have a website, even if it was simple. And I chose to do it on google sites because it is extremely easy. Here it is if you want to visit it. www.rustyrobozs.com

And that's all folks, this is how we created a project bringing together Artificial Intelligence, blockchain, and quantum computing. The definitive Buzzword project.
