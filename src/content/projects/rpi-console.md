raspberry pi 3 Model B REtro Console

Portable retro console with 3.5 inch screen, powered by a raspberry pi 3 model B, and using the emulation software Retropie). It does not have its own speakers but you can connect any normal headphones, and it is played with two super nintendo usb controllers from Amazon, it also has a 5000mAh portable battery also from Amazon attached. Virtually all NES, SNES, Sega Master System, Sega Megadrive, Sega Game Gear, Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, and many other older or lesser known systems work, and even some PS1 and N64 games work like Mario Kart or Star Wars Episode I: Racer. It's cool because you can remove the hdmi connector from the raspberry pi to connect it to any television or monitor with HDMI and play on the big screen. Ideal to carry in the backpack and play anywhere with a screen or even without it, and it is a great way to play classics that you missed at the time, I ended up finishing Castelvania Aria of Sorrow and Dragon Ball Advance Adventure for GBA.
