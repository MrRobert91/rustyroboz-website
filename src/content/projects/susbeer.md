For my girlfriend's birthday, I created a virtual reality experience using the Unity game engine and the Meta Quest 2 headset. I also used some assets and models sourced from the internet. Due to time constraints, it’s a basic prototype where the rough finish is part of its charm.

In the experience, personalized songs generated with AI using Suno AI play in the background. You can explore different spaces, such as a forest or a maze filled with paintings and characters you need to escape from. The maze also contains some secrets to discover, including real-world locations scanned in 3D, like a Riad in Marrakesh or various rooms of a house. For the 3D scanning, I used Kiri Engine. There are also challenges, like crossing a narrow walkway without falling while carrying a key.

The experience is a personal gift, and its charm lies in the personalized songs and various inside jokes, which is why it’s not available for download.
